# OPENAI GYM Enduro

This repository contains an implementation of **Duel Deep Q-Network (DQN)** agent running in a [OPENAI GYM Enduro](https://gym.openai.com/envs/Enduro-ram-v0) Environment that can be used to train and evaluate models.

Maximize your score in the Atari 2600 game Enduro. In this environment, the observation is the RAM of the Atari machine, consisting of (only!) 128 bytes.
